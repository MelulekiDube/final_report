\section{ETHICAL, PROFESSIONAL, AND LEGAL ISSUES}\label{sec:ethical,-professional,-and-legal-issues}
This tool involves the collection of personal user data, which is going to be recorded and stored in a database for viewing by the stakeholders in the application in one way or another.
Therefore, we need to ensure that we have consent for recording user data from users before recording their data and after getting their consent we had to ensure that the data is safely stored and cannot be traced back to the users.
To ensure privacy of user is guaranteed two main things where done:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For measurement data collection, we hashed the user names associated with the data we were recording.
    Therefore, in the measurements' database instead of user names we stored the hashed username values.
    \item We also instead of storing the exact location that data is recorded we stored the coarse location, which is an approximate location.
    This ensures that the data recorded cannot also be tied to a specific location but rather increasing chances of identifying users.
\end{enumerate}
The above measures all where put to reduce the chances of users accessing data that is not meant for them and only allowing owners of the data being able view their data knowingly.
