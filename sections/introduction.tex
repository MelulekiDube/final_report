\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Community networks are large-scale decentralized networks that are built and operated by the citizens\cite{Selimi:2014:TAD:2723218.2723265}.
The networks are at times run by non-profit organizations who can cooperate with stakeholders to develop community services, which include the internet and local networking\cite{Braem:2013:CRC:2500098.2500108}.
These networks are becoming more and more popular for providing Internet access to remote areas.
They are ideal as they are distributed and meaning there is no single point of failure and  as they can be managed by the users of the network.
As these networks are mostly managed by the users in the network it will be good to have a monitoring system that users, and the providers of the network could have used to look at how the network is performing.
This paper then focuses on building a Monitoring tool for the community networks with Inethi as a case study.
